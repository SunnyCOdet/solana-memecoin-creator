# Solana RPC Endpoint for Devnet

# Port for the backend server
PORT=5000

# NOTE: The payer keypair is generated in tokenCreator.ts for simplicity in this example.
# In a real application, you would likely load a persistent keypair from a secure location
# or handle transaction signing/payment differently (e.g., via the user's wallet).
# The public key of the generated payer will be logged when the backend starts.
# Ensure this keypair is funded with Devnet SOL.
